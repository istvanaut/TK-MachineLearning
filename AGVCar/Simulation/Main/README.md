# How to simulate the environments for an autonomous vehicle in CARLA (outdated)

---

## 1. Download CARLA

[Download CARLA](https://github.com/carla-simulator/carla/blob/master/Docs/download.md)

I used version 0.9.10

---
## 2. Unzip the download

After this step, CARLA is ready to use

---
## 3. Test run CARLA

Run *CarlaUE4.exe*

It should take about 30 seconds to load

* Move with WASD, hold LMB to look around

If it runs poorly, restart it with the setting ``-quality-level=Low`` (launch it from cmd with this flag) - this improves performance by a lot

Optionally use ``-ResX=200 -ResY=200`` to change resolution - but this appears to have no impact on performance

---
## 4. Run example Python scripts

Example Python scripts are in CARLA's folder in ``/PythonAPI/examples``

To run a script you must install certain Python packages (numpy, matplotlib, etc.) and the carla package

The carla package is included in the download at ``/PythonAPI/carla/dist`` and uses Python 3.7

If you have multiple Python versions installed, use the command ``py -3.7 xxx.py`` to run a xxx.py with the right version

For example the scripts ``spawn_npc.py`` and ``manual_control.py`` should be working and have noticeable effect

To change the map, run ``config.py`` from ``/PythonAPI/util`` with the argument ``-m MAPNAME``

If another script gives a timeout error, you probably have to specify the host (localhost) and port (2000) in the command line arguments

---
## 5. Run custom Python script
Run the ``main.py`` of this project (with python 3.7)

To check logs, see ``files/carla.log`` (logging to files might be disabled by default)

You can use the plugin Grep Console to make console output prettier

## 5.b Every step to set up simulation from repo in an IDE

1. Clone repo from GitHub
   
2. Open project

3. Right click and mark as *Sources root*:

    I) ``Simulation/Tamás Visy/CARLA``
   
    II) ``Simulation/Tamás Visy/Network`` 
   
    III) ``Microcontroller/Network``

4. Then place ``/PythonAPI/carla/dist/carla-0.9.10-py3.7-win-amd64.egg`` from the CARLA installation
   into ``Simulation/Carla/files``
